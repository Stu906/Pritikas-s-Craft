Myself Reema Jain that wants to share happines and love with the warmth of my handmade products. I always love to do craft work but never taken it seriously. It was my daughter's first rakshabandhan in 2014. Everyone wants to serve their brothers beautiful rakhis placed in beautiful plates, so I decided to make rakhis at home and decorated a plate .... they turned out to be beautiful and appreciated by everyone. After all handmade things are crafted with love, that reaches automatically to the person you give. Next year I made rakhi's again and got the orders also, so now it became interesting. One day I visited itsy bitsy delhi by chance just to get some craft material and was surprised to see the carft world, the paints, brushes, stencils, ink. I was just unaware of a dream world so I began to explore more and more, searched number of youtube channels, learnt number of things.Now I deal in decopage bottles, watchboxes, candles, rakhis, scrap books, nameplates, wall decos, diwali decor. All this started after my daughter's birth so I named my facebook  page after my daughter- Pritika's craft. Pritika's craft always keeps on exploring new things and serves their customers with lots of love. Happy you, Happy me.
